    <h1>New CSS Feature</h1>
    <h2>The Initial-Letter</h2>
    <main>
      <p>The new CSS feature; initial-letter, allows developers to more easily control and customize their drop cap. You can specify how many lines it occupies, color, position, size, and weight. There plenty of additional styling developers can do as well, including shadows and gradients. I really enjoyed using this new feature. </p>
